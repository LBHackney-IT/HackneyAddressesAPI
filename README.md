# Hackney Addresses API

We will use this API when developing applications and services for the London Borough of Hackney. This ensures consistency and enables linking of data across the organisation (via the [Unique Property Reference Number](https://www.geoplace.co.uk/addresses/uprn)).

This API provides a limited interface to Hackney's [Local Land and Property Gazetteer](https://www.geoplace.co.uk/helpdesk/supporting-the-dca/address-custodians/importance-of-the-llpg) and to the [National Address Gazetteer](https://www.geoplace.co.uk/addresses/national-address-gazetteer).

This API tries to maintain conformance to the draft [Hackney API Standards](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/api-standards).
